**Privacy and Security Policies for a HIPAA-Compliant Web Application**

---

**Purpose**
This document outlines the privacy and security policies to ensure compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) for a web application. The application uses an encrypted SQLite database, HTTPS for encryption in transit, HIPAA-compliant text messaging through Google Voice (with a Business Associate Agreement), and implements data backup and recovery processes.

**2. Data Security Policy**

**2.1 Database Security:**
- The SQLite database is encrypted using industry-standard encryption algorithms to ensure data security at rest.
- Database access requires authentication via unique user IDs and strong passwords.

**2.2 Network Security:**
- HTTPS is implemented to encrypt all data in transit.
- SSL/TLS certificates are regularly reviewed and renewed to maintain secure communication channels.

- Full backups of the SQLite database are performed daily.

**3.2 Backup Security:**
- Backups are encrypted before being stored.
- Backup files are stored on premise.

**3.3 Disaster Recovery:**
- The recovery process is tested quarterly to ensure rapid restoration of services in the event of data loss.
